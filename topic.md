This was my fist class with UMUC, IFSM 201 A302 Concepts and applications of information technology.  I have learned a great deal about how the internet works with servers, and how the websites are designed by using code to create the information on the screen.

I have enjoyed the process to learn this during my course and I look forward to my next UMUC course.
